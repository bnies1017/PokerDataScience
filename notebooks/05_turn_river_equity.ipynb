    "## Section 03: Turn and River Equity Calculation\n",
    "**Abstract**: In this notebook, we calculate the turn and river equity for each player's hand based on various engineered features derived from the hole cards and community cards. This involves grouping hands by these features and estimating the equity for each group, similar to the approach used for pre-flop and flop equity calculations. Differences in hand features and the results of this experiment rely on the fact that only one more card is to come on the turn, and none on the river, therefore the player's hand is less likely to change in strength compared to the flop."

This also might be caused by the fact that most Straight Flushes are using more of the board than of players' hole cards, causing most Straight Flushes that come out to be somewhat shared by the players.
