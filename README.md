# Poker Data Science #
A repository dedicated to the analysis and modeling of poker game data using data science techniques.
## Overview ##
This repository contains various scripts and notebooks that aim to explore poker game data, perform statistical analysis, and build predictive models. The goal is to gain insights into player behavior, game dynamics, and strategies that can improve performance in poker games. So far, the notebooks calculate equity estimates based on hand features over Monte-Carlo data.
